TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Exercise 1**

The most important thing I learnt from exercise 1 was how useful dictionaries are for recalling information and how functions can be used to simplify and refactor information. The exercise was about turning a poorly written piece of code into a series of functions which refactored the same thing in a more succinct manner. The main part of the exercise was creating functions which calculated facts about a triangle which could then be recalled in a dictionary under a 'master function' which could recall everything.

**Exercise 2**

Exercise 2 focused more on the concept of recursion. Recursion is the concept of reiteration of a set of axioms or rules to a source input which continuously regenerates an output until a condition is satisfied (in most cases, this was when the guard reached zero). The second half of the exercise required drawing a koch curve based on the python package, 'turtle'. The package is an introduction to programming package which simplifies commands by controlling a turtle which can draw shapes. Recursion was used in this by applying fractals in the koch curves, which are a type of recursion based on branches and are found in phenomena like snowflakes. 

**Data Project**

This week, the data project made progress in the way of categorising the data and finding out some basic facts about library. I think this is a good place to start as it would give the reader an idea of the _library_ that I listen to before they delve deeper into my listening _habits_. I did this by just generating some basic charts and histograms about my listening genres, song durations and other pieces of information. I also did a bit of research into the type of data within my json file (ie. boolean, string, integer etc) so I have an idea of what I'm dealing with.

I think a good way of structing my project would be splitting it into two sections:

_1. Library data (insights about the type of music I listen to)_

_2. Listening data (insights about how I listen to my music)_

This structure would correspond well with my data sets and would be easy to follow along with.
