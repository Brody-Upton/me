TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Data Project**
This week I had some issues cleaning up my data set and deleting columns which had all entries as 'NaN' due to gaps in the dataset (stuff like album rating and song likes which I don't participate in when I use Apple Music). I believe the issue was to do with already deleting a column and then trying to delete it again (you can't delete something which isn't there). However, when I try and recall the dataset again it still keeps the columns that I thought I deleted. I'll have to clear this up or work on manipulating the dataset to get it as simple and useful as possible.
