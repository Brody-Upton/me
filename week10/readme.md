TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Data Project**

This week is quickly becoming a better week for the project. I started diving into the listening dataset which is much more useful and flexible than the library data. I've noticed that the library dataset has very inaccurate readings for things like play count and skip count whereas the listening dataset doesn't have any errors/gaps/inaccuracies as it is literally a dataset of every song I have ever listened to on my account. 

With the new dataset I've started looking at things like: activity, favourite artists/songs, comparing genre distribution of library with listening habits of genre. I feel like there is so much in this dataset that I won't get to discover it all before presentation in week 11 but we'll have to see. With this listening data I am focusing on time/based representation so I can see how much I listen to songs by day/month/year. It would also be great to see trends based on time as I feel there is more potential to find something unexpected as opposed to something I could already guess.
