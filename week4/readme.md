TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Exercise 1**

This weeks exercises were interesting. The hardest part was being able to navigate the me directory in order to be able to read and write in files using ../ and ..\. I learnt how to navigate a JSON file as it is essentially a large dictionary and series of drop down menus. It requires the recall of items from a dictionary using words in quotation marks "" and objects in lists using indexing []. I still don't quite understand the various json commands like the difference between data = json.dumps() and data = open(filepath, r). 

**Data project**

I made significant process on the direction of the data project by receiving my apple music data after requesting it. The data is provided in JSON and Excel data and I now need to find out which will be easier to use when extracting and analysing the data. A couple of interesting areas I want to look at is my listening habits for: song length, song artist, song genre, song features, daily listening habits, most listened to songs, least listened to songs, details about song duration etc. My goal for this project is just to find out something interesting about my music listening habits as I tend to just listen to music rather than analyse *how* I listen to music. I'll be getting the data set and asking questions later rather than starting with a question and finding the right data sets.
