TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Exam**

This week was the coding exam. I felt like I could get through all questions pretty well apart from the last three. They were pretty tough because they dealt with dictionaries and reading/writing files which I was still a little inexperienced on. The last fast filler exercise was pretty difficult because it required a combination of everything learnt in the term.

**Data Project**

Data project progress is slow but steady. This week involved learning more about the library dataset before moving on to my listening dataset. This included looking at the years that each song was released and the proportion of songs which have features which ended up being ~27%. I'll start looking at listening data in week 10 and maybe doing some comparisons to see if my listening habits reflect my library.
