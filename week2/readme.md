TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

I would like to summarise this week with a little analogy. Trying to teach the computer to solve problems with my code is a bit like a teacher teaching their class by using a white whiteboard marker. 

This week, I found exercises 0, 1 and 2 to be very informative and straight forward. Exercise 0 was simple enough as it defined functions which only required 1 line between the *def* line and the *return* line. However, python vocabulary was still an issue as text like ".upper" was completely alien to me (had it not been hinted to me in the question). 

Exercise 1 was great for predicting what a line of code would do without actually knowing for sure. I found that a lot of the time, I took the command too literally based on the wording and not the logic behind it.

Exercise 2 was great for learning to debug code. I partially understood how to use breakpoints but I think I need to revise how to test certain parts of my code to save time rather than testing the entire document. I tried my hardest to understand what the code actually did rather than just debugging it and moving on, but lack of vocabulary ("wordArray", ".join") made it diffcult (this seems to be a reoccuring theme).

Exercise 3: While I can easily picture the solution to a problem in my head and the steps I need to take, I find it difficult to get the *computer* to understand it through the code. 

For the star problem, I found it relatively easy to picture how the solution would look. I could solve it by having an empty list and mapping a single character ("*") to each place in the list. Yet, applying this sort of logic didn't work when translating that idea into code. I think this is perhaps due to a lack of knowledge of python conventions, vocabulary and know-how.

This exercise was extremely tough as it required actually understanding how code is applied and relied a lot on convention (proper use of lists, maps, loops, function definition, return)
