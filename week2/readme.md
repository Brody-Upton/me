TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Exercises**
{}
This week, I found exercises 0, 1 and 2 to be very informative and straight forward. Exercise 0 was simple enough as it defined functions which only required 1 line between the *def* line and the *return* line. However, python vocabulary was still an issue as text like ".upper" was completely alien to me (had it not been hinted to me in the question). 
{}
Exercise 1 was great for predicting what a line of code would do without actually knowing for sure. I found that a lot of the time, I took the command too literally based on the wording and not the logic behind it.
{}
Exercise 2 was great for learning to debug code. I partially understood how to use breakpoints but I think I need to revise how to test certain parts of my code to save time rather than testing the entire document. I tried my hardest to understand what the code actually did rather than just debugging it and moving on, but lack of vocabulary ("wordArray", ".join") made it diffcult (this seems to be a reoccuring theme).
{}
Exercise 3: While I can easily picture the solution to a problem in my head and the steps I need to take, I find it difficult to get the *computer* to understand it through the code. 
{}
For the star problem, I found it relatively easy to picture how the solution would look. I could solve it by having an empty list and mapping a single character ("*") to each place in the list. Yet, applying this sort of logic didn't work when translating that idea into code. I think this is perhaps due to a lack of knowledge of python conventions, vocabulary and know-how.
{}
The pyramid exercise was the toughest of all the exercises for this week. Like all the other exercises, I knew a variety of ways which could be solved but couldn't translate each idea easily into code in order for it to work. I considered adding a wedge of spaces, a wedge of stars and a wedge of spaces side by side but this looked at the problem to visually and not like a programmer would. Would led me to the solution was considering other commands in python (if statements, else, elif, while, for etc.) as I was getting tunnel vision by just looking at for loops. It was really satisfying when the code actually worked after a lot of struggle. I was also happy as the length of the code was short for the problem it was meant to solve.

**Readings**
{}
Last weeks reading were interesting too. *Maker vs Manager's schedule* was about how differently a programmer schedules their time as opposed to a typical manager. Programmers work in large blocks of time where they can concentrate on a project whereas a manager has a flexible schedule which is made up of one hour time slots which are convenient for meetings.
{}
The reading on complex systems was great as well. It gave rise to the importance of thinking non-intuitively when thinking of iterative loops in real life situation (bushfires and forest growth).

If I learnt anything from this week, it is to learn more python vocabulary and commands to make my life easier.
