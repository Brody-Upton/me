TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Non-teaching week**

This week consisted of working on finalising the recursion exercises (more specifically the turtle drawing component of week 5 exercise two). It focused on fractals and the use of recursion to build an increasingly complex curve based on the order of the fractal. It was interesting playing around with the turtle library but I would like to go back over it and become more familiar with how the library works. It was also a little difficult to debug and understand each line of code as it was hard to keep the window open while running the code.

**Data project**

Little progress was made on the data project this week. I managed to clean up my graphs a little bit by putting them in the right order and adding more labels to them. A call was set up with Ben where I was able to clarify some directions that I could take with the project which mainly consisted of my listening habits as opposed to my library (the habits will be much more interesting and less intuitive).
