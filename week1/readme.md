TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

**Exercises**
{}
This first lab has been quite interesting. Setting up the recall between visual studio code and github gave me an idea about how code is quite mechanical in directing a computer to achieve a task. 
{}
Things like using "../" and "./" as well as "cp me" and "cp course" to navigate directories in my computer led me to understand how code operates. 
{}
The whole process of "forking" and "cloning" with github was useful as well. 
{}
I'm looking forward to using this whole system as it seems to be working well so far. I would like to become more confident and self-sufficient regarding troubleshooting and debugging. I think it would be a useful skill to confidently find solutions to the code issues I come across.
