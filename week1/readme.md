TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.

This first lab has been quite interesting. Setting up the recall between visual studio code and github gave me an idea about how code is quite mechanical in directing a computer to achieve a task. 

Things like using "../" and "./" as well as "cp me" and "cp course" to navigate directories in my computer led me to understand how code operates. 

The whole process of "forking" and "cloning" with github was useful as well.
